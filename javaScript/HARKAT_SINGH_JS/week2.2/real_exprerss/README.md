doctors have skills 
they have accquired that skills over years
they provide services to other people who want to use their skills


to expose there life skills they open a clicik 
people who want to use their skills line up in a waiting roon one by one the doctor meets them 
the doctor is single threaded (because he is intended to see only one person at a particular time )


now how do people reach the doctor?
they get their address and navigate to it

note==> u cannot get into the doctors room directly (you have to wait in the loby until he is free to attend you )a nd they specifically has a door for it to get enter

on looking at the patient he can even suggest the patient to go and get the medicine till then he can have a look on other patient issues this is similar to deligating the task

note==> once that patient comes back with the medicine he cannot meet the doctor immideatley he will have to again wait in the wating room until the doctor becaomes free to check him again
