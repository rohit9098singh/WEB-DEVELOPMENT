 REACT IS JUST A ESIER WAY TO WRITE NORMAL HTML AND CSS AND JS ..

ITS A NEW SYNTAX THAT UNDER THE HOOD GETS CONVERTED TO HTML/CSS/JS

============================================================

                     SOME JARGONS
   to create a react app, you usually need to worry about just two things 

   creator of frontend framework realised that all  the website can efectively be divided into two parts :-

   1) STATE - all object represent the current state of the app it represent the dynamic things in your app (things that changes) for example, the value of the counter

 2) COMPONENT- how a dom element should render given a state it is a re-usable dynamic HTML snippet that changes given the state 


 NOTE:::- You usually have to define all your componets once and then you have to do is update the state of your app,React will take care of re-rendering your app
