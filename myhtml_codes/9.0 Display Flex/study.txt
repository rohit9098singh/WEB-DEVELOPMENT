The difference between relative and absolute positioning in CSS lies in how elements are positioned within their containing elements.
Relative Positioning:When you set an element's position to "relative," it is positioned relative to its normal position in the document flow.
The element will be moved from its default position based on the values you provide for the top, right, bottom, or left properties.
Other elements on the page will still occupy the space the element would have taken in its normal position.


.When you set an element's position to "absolute," it is positioned relative to its nearest positioned ancestor 
(an ancestor with a position other than "static") or to the containing block.
Absolute positioned elements are taken out of the normal document flow, so they won't affect the layout of other elements.
If there is no positioned ancestor, the element is positioned relative to the initial containing block (usually the <html> element)


In summary, relative positioning adjusts an element's position based on its normal position in the document flow, whereas absolute
 positioning positions an element relative to its containing block or nearest positioned ancestor, taking it out of the normal document flow.
